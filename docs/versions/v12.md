# What's New in Dalamud v12 (draft)

Dalamud v12 is the current major version of Dalamud, and will release with Patch
7.2. This is a high-level overview of changes. You can see a code diff of all of
these changes [here.](https://github.com/goatcorp/dalamud/compare/master...net9)

## Key Information

- **Branch:** `api12`
  ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud/tree/net9))
- **Release Date:** March 25, 2025
- **API Level:** 12
- **.NET Version:** .NET 9.0

## Major Changes

- Dalamud now uses .NET 9.
    - If you use Dalamud.NET.Sdk, your plugin will automatically use the new .NET version and API level upon upgrading to v12+.
    - If not, you will have to change your target framework to `net9.0-windows`.
    - You will have to [install the .NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) to build plugins targeting this Dalamud version.
- The `ObjectTable` service will now throw an `InvalidOperationException` on certain operations not performed in the main thread.
- Corrupt state exceptions (e.g. `AccessViolationException`) will no longer be caught by the CLR.
- A new (experimental) `ISeStringEvaluator` service has been added for ease of working with, well, SeStrings.
    - The experimental flag will be removed in a future update during the 7.2 cycle.

## Minor Changes

- `SummonerGauge` and `DarkKnightGauge` had extra fields from ClientStructs added.
    - Certain properties in `SummonerGauge` were renamed.
- The `Easing#Value` property has been deprecated. Devs should select either `ValueClamped` or `ValueUnclamped` depending on their use case.
- `PluginLoadReason` is now a `[Flags]` enum.
